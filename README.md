# Build-Your-Own-Path
App for students that are looking for **information of the careers** in different universities. It's made **for all students**, mainly focused in 5th semester students.
This app offers an opportunity for students to **create their profile** and search for a university including features like students' profile, synthesized information of each career in one university, recommended careers based in the students profile and their interests, average of excel document with grades, and recomended scholarships, making an efficient and quick app for anyone who needs it. The student will be able to save a file with their grades in the app, so it calculates the average and therefore give feedback on it; the grade average will also be used to determine wether the student will need to consider specific requirements, like the PAA, so the student can start preparing for it. There will be given some links that will help the student study or practice for entrance exams.

The order of files for the app to work are: 
1. main.py
2. careers.py

# Reflection: 
We have made a lot of progress for this phase, but some aspects still need to be improved, as we struggled a little with the pandas. Overall, we are happy with how the project is looking.
