# Build-Your-Own-Path
App for students that are looking for information on the careers of different universities. It's made for all students, mainly focused in 5th semester students.
This app offers an opportunity for students to create their profile and search for a university including features like students profile, universities information, synthesized information of each career in one university and also recommend careers in base of the students profile, making an efficient and quick app for anyone who needs it. The student will be able to insert or save a file with their grades in the app, so it calculates the average and therefore give feedback on it. 
The order of files for the app to work are: 
1. main.py
2. careers.py

# Reflection: 
We have made a lot of progress for this phase, but some aspects still need to be improved, as we struggled a little with the pandas. Overall, we are happy with how the project is looking.
